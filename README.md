# Annuus
Annuus is a mod for minecraft networking,
improves network performance and makes the game more available for running on large server.

Supported minecraft 1.21.4 with fabric loader, needs fabric-api.

When the player doesn't install annuus on the client, network packet will send normally like vanilla.

Annuus is only useful in very bad network conditions or with many players,
because annuus lets data size smaller but latency (in data calculates, not networking) is higher a little.
